We ran into some difficulties with our leap motion and given the amount of time left we felt that it would
be better if we restart our project with a different idea.
What we decided to make is a Snowman shooting game where the player is a snowman and shoots snowballs at targets, scoring points.
The targets are stationary and the player is able to move its snowman around the screen accordingly.
